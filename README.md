# `@statewalker/models`

An implementation of reactive classes using `@preact/signals-core` library.

Note: this project depends on the following packages:

* [@statewalker/eslint-config](https://github.com/statewalker/statewalker-config-eslint)
* [@statewalker/typescript-config](https://github.com/statewalker/statewalker-config-typescript)

They are not published in NPM (yet), so they have to be installed in the same workspace with this project.
